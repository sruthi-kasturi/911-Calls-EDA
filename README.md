# 911 Calls Data Capstone Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of 911 calls to gain insights into the nature and distribution of emergency incidents. The analysis aims to identify patterns, trends, and significant findings related to emergency calls.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about 911 calls, including:
- Time of the call
- Location of the incident
- Type of emergency
- Description of the incident

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Visualize the distribution of 911 calls over time and across different locations.
- Analyze the types of emergencies and their frequencies.
- Identify trends and patterns in the data.

## Analysis and Insights
### Time Series Analysis
- Visualization of 911 calls over time to identify trends and peak times for emergency incidents.

### Location Analysis
- Mapping 911 calls to understand the geographical distribution of incidents.
- Identifying hotspots for different types of emergencies.

### Emergency Types Analysis
- Breakdown of 911 calls by type (e.g., medical, fire, traffic).
- Analyzing the most common types of emergencies.

### Key Findings
- Identification of patterns and trends in 911 calls.
- Insights into the most frequent types of emergencies and their distribution over time and location.

## Technologies and Tools
- Python for data analysis and visualization
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- GeoPandas for geographical mapping

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into emergency call data, which can help in resource allocation, emergency response planning, and improving public safety measures.
